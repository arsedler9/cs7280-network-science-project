# CS7280 Final Project
This repo documents my final project for a network science course at Georgia Tech, where I used variational graph autoencoders (VGAEs) to capture the underlying structure of a dataset of unlabeled structural brain networks computed from structural MRI (Human Connectome Project). See `paper.pdf` for the full write-up.
